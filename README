Land Use & Land Cover Classification with EuroSAT

> Background  

This project was developed as part of the Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI) مبادرة رواد مصر الرقمية under the AI & Data Science track.  
It represents the culmination of a 6-month intensive training program, combining advanced coursework with practical, real-world applications in artificial intelligence and data science.

Land use and land cover (LULC) classification is critical for agriculture, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. Using Sentinel-2 imagery and the EuroSAT dataset , we frame the task as supervised multi-class image classification.  

The model learns spectral + spatial patterns with CNNs (and experiments with ViTs) to automatically classify land cover types.
